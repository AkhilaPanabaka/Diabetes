Readmission Possibility of Diabetic Patients
- Built a robust machine learning model to predict whether a diabetic patient is going to be readmitted within 30 days or not.
- Even 5% reduction in US overall hospital readmission rates would result in an estimated annual cost savings of 1.2$ billion.
- With about 50 predictor variables like age, medications, procedures, test results etc., readmission possibility was predicted with 93% Accuracy and 0.86 f1-score.
- Algorithms/ Techniques used: Random Forest, XGBoost, Stacking Classifiers, SMOTE for Data Imbalance
